## ReVISit

Welcome to the reVISit project. Our goal is to develop the infrastructure to democratize, accelerate, and advance our ability to conduct crowdsourced studies to evaluate visualization systems.

This project is a joint research and development effort between the University of Utah, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Toronto. We receive funding by the National Science Foundation. 

The main project page is at https://revisit.dev/. 

You can check out a demo of various studies at https://revisit.dev/study/.

The main repository you might care about if you want to create a study is https://github.com/revisit-studies/study.
