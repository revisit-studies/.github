## reVISit

Welcome to the reVISit project. Our goal is to develop the infrastructure to democratize, accelerate, and advance our ability to conduct crowdsourced studies to evaluate visualization systems.

This project is a joint research and development effort between the University of Utah, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Toronto, funded by the National Science Foundation. 

You can visit our deployment by visiting https://revisit.dev.
